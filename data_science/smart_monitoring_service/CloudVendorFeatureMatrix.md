# Introduction

Part of our product development is walking the fine line between utilizing major cloud vendor \(AWS, Azure & GCP\) features yet avoiding lock-in.

This page is intended to be a one-stop resource for general guidance for comparing vendor offerings to maximize our use of off-the-shelf technology yet be able to move our products with minimal effort between vendors.

| | NoSQL	Document or key-value based | DynamoDB: single-digit msec reads for key-value or document stores, fully managed, most popular NoSQL DB, fairly expensive | DocumentDB | * Bigtable: fairly expensive * Datastore: for webscale
| | Relational (OLTP) | | Aurora: faster, cheaper MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible DB, fully managed. Limits: 32 vCPUs, 244GiB memory storage up to 64TB | AzureSQL | * Spanner: infinite-scale RDBMS with sub 10 msec read access *Cloud SQL: MySQL & PostgreSQL (you manage)
| | | RDS	Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, MarieDB, PostgreSQL | | Microsoft SQL Server, 
| |  Analytics (OLAP) | Huge scale, managed, VERY reliable (11 9's?) | 1) Athena: columnar, SQL-based engine that maintains metadata to efficiently query S3 data sources, integrates with Glue for ETL & discovery; [Tuning Tips](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/top-10-performance-tuning-tips-for-amazon-athena/), 2) Redshift: relational, fully managed analytics DB a) Redshift Spectrum: SQL queries on S3 in data formats you already use, including CSV, TSV, Parquet, Sequence, and RCFile. | * [Data Lake Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/the-intelligent-data-lake/): analyze data lake datasets (serverless), Python interface, U-SQL for queries, billed in "[Analytics Hours](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/data-lake-analytics/)." * HDInsight: Hadoop infrastructure, Kafka & Spark, scalable R envrionment, Jupyter notebook | [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/): petabyte-scale columnar DB
| Stream Processing | | | | |
| | Large scale | | Datapipeline: windowed batch data processing framework that stores to S3, DynamoDB, RDS or EMR | [Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/stream-analytics/): use Streaming Analytics Query Language, | [DataFlow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/): 
| Messaging | | | | |
